# Project Name

**Author**: Andrew Peacock and Chris Hemenes
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Our problem domain was to take a mostly functioning backend and mesh it with a function front end by creating a server, and using that server to store/cough up data entered by a user from the View.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
One must first invent the universe. After a few steps between there and here, you will have a front end with a pleasant UI and a backend which wants things to interface with it. Then you must add information to a server.js that will allow your front end and backend to communicate. 

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
We used express, Node.JS, Nodemon, VSCode, Google, and the help of ever patient TAs. 

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.-->
05-15-2018 0915- began work on this lab
05-15-2018 1130- began making changes to server.js and got the backend listening
